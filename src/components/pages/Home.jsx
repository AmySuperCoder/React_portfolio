         My name is Amy Griffith, and I'm on a journey to become a world-class developer. I have experience doing technical support for a software company and writing user manuals 
         and other technical documents. One of my greatest strengths is that I have the heart of an educator. I have spent decades teaching other people, including working as a writer 
         and editor at a computing magazine and teaching in middle school and high school classrooms. My writing and spoken explanations are clear and always geared toward helping 
         others around me get a clear grasp on the topic at hand.
